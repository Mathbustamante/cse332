2. The benefit is that by creating and assembling the parts of a complex object 
directly within a class is inflexible. Yes, the class has to commit to a fixed representation of the object.

3. Because it separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction 
process can create different representations. No problem, the addition is just one part of the calculator operations.

4. I dont think so, because the idea of the builder pattern is to separete the algorithm for interpreting the code
from the one that is building.
