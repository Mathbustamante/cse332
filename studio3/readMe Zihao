2.The program produced "studio_3.exe", which is the name of the program itself. The name of the program is always stored in
position 0 of the argument vector.
3."studio_3.exe" in one column. 
4. 1)reference in c++ acts as the object itself while pointer stores the memory address of the object. 2)reference has to be
initialized to refer to an oject and only this object, while pointers can be initialized by pointing to nothing and the object
it points to can be changed. 3)reference must be typed, while pointer doesn't necessarily.
In this particular case, the program produces unreadable results. Since reference acts as the object, incrementing r changes the
object's value as well, thus the result is unexpected.
5.Didn't see any difference
6.* operator dereferences the pointer which is used to get the content of the argument. ++ is used to increment the address to
look for.
