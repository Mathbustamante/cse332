1. Group members:
	Matheus Bustamante 
	Zihao Chen

2. The member variable, result, should be private and the
constructors, destructors, and methods should be public.

3. Main can call the calculate and the getresult methods
to perform the addition.

4. Changed to result *= x on the calculate method to perform multiplication
instead of addition.

5. Declared the interface inheritance. 

6. Using the : public operator to inherit from a base class. Since we have
multiple classes inheriting from the same one, this is the Heirarchical Inheritance.

7. The program behaves as expected, and the variable is updated at run time.
